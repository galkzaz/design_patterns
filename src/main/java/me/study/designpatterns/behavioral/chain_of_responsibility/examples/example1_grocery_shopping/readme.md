Your vision of the future is taking shape: You have a refrigerator with an RFID receiver.
The fill level of your beer bottles is checked regularly. Even if the number of slices of
sausage and cheese drops, it will be registered. And if eggs and bread are running low, the
fridge will know that too. Of course, since you’re a motivated programmer, you don’t have
time to go to the supermarket to shop yourself. Fortunately, stores in the area have banded
together to form an electronic supply chain. When refrigerators report that a customer is
running low on a product, each of the retailers checks to see if he can bring the customer
new food. If not, they pass the order on to the next possible retailer.
