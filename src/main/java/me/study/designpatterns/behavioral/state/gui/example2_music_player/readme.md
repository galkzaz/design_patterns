# Music Player
https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state/rust/example

Let’s build a music player with the following state transitions:

State machine
There is a base trait State with play and stop methods which make state transitions:

pub trait State {
    fn play(self: Box<Self>, player: &mut Player) -> Box<dyn State>;
    fn stop(self: Box<Self>, player: &mut Player) -> Box<dyn State>;
}
next and prev don’t change state, there are default implementations in a separate impl dyn State block that cannot be overridden.

impl dyn State {
    pub fn next(self: Box<Self>, player: &mut Player) -> Box<dyn State> {
        self
    }

    pub fn prev(self: Box<Self>, player: &mut Player) -> Box<dyn State> {
        self
    }
}
Every state is a type implementing the trait State:

pub struct StoppedState;
pub struct PausedState;
pub struct PlayingState;

impl State for StoppedState {
    ...
}

impl State for PausedState {
    ...
}
Anyways, it works as follows:

let state = Box::new(StoppedState);   // StoppedState.
let state = state.play(&mut player);  // StoppedState -> PlayingState.
let state = state.play(&mut player);  // PlayingState -> PausedState.
Here, the same action play makes a transition to different states depending on where it’s called from:

StoppedState's implementation of play starts playback and returns PlayingState.

fn play(self: Box<Self>, player: &mut Player) -> Box<dyn State> {
    player.play();

    // Stopped -> Playing.
    Box::new(PlayingState)
}
PlayingState pauses playback after hitting the “play” button again:

fn play(self: Box<Self>, player: &mut Player) -> Box<dyn State> {
    player.pause();

    // Playing -> Paused.
    Box::new(PausedState)
}
The methods are defined with a special self: Box<Self> notation.

Why is that?

First, self is not a reference, it means that the method is a “one shot”, it consumes self and exchanges onto another state returning Box<dyn State>.
Second, the method consumes the boxed object like Box<dyn State> and not an object of a concrete type like PlayingState, because the concrete state is unknown at compile time.
